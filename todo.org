- [X] warn when creating migration tables in a non-empty database
- [X] error when there are migrations with duplicate numbers
- [X] determine changes to patch files by running md5sum of migrations
- [ ] when test database is not setup present simple commands to create those
      (create user, db, privileges, etc)
- [ ] test when user host privilege is incorrect
- [ ] test when host for schema privilege is incorrect
- [ ] cleanup temp files used for testing purposes with final signal trap
- [ ] write more documentation in README
- [ ] make sure this also work on non os x machines
- [ ] when migrations caused errors there are probably different methods of
      resolving the error and continuing, we should support those in an easy way
- [ ] robustness: use 'set -e', and other good shell scripting practices (see
      wooledge wiki, books, ..)
- [ ] think about: do we also want to support rollbacks? (e.g. down
      migrations)
- [ ] when a lot of migrations are run (for instance when you are building a
      database from scratch), running all migrations might take a long time.
      we could provide a way to pack (like git-pack) stacks of migrations into
      one 'snapshot', to make the migration run faster.
- [ ] support other databases: sqlite, postgres, ..?
- [ ] think about: what to do when there is already a migrations table, but
      it's not created by migrate?
- [ ] think about: should we really require the database password to be in the
      migrations configuration file?
- [ ] support for integration with frameworks and other build systems by also
      allowing: migrations dir to be elsewhere and/or named differently, have
      config setting be provided in environment variables and/or parameters
- [ ] have test suite run standalone: don't require a locally running mysql
      server, instead start mysqld for testing purposes locally (on a
      different port)
- [ ] think about: should we really manage one database at a time? or should
      we migrate 'sets of databases'? yagni for now
- [ ] make sure that 'show tables like migrations' does not throw 'unknown
      table 'migrations' - handle this differently perhaps?
- [ ] determine if something safer than md5, such as sha1, is needed for this
      application. make a trade off for this and portability
- [ ] migration IDs should be positive integers
- [X] test: only .sql files are treated as migration files
- [X] what to do when there are files in the migrations directory which are
      not numbered
- [X] migrations should be executed in order
