- [ ] test: only .sql files are treated as migration files
- [ ] finish README
- [ ] think about: should we really require the database password to be in the
      migrations configuration file?
- [ ] test when user host privilege is incorrect
- [ ] test when host for schema privilege is incorrect
- [ ] have test suite run standalone: don't require a locally running mysql server, instead start mysqld for testing purposes locally (on a different port)
- [ ] warn when creating migration tables in a non-empty database
- [ ] think about: should we really manage one database at a time? or should we migrate 'sets of databases'? yagni for now
- [ ] make sure that 'show tables like migrations' does not throw 'unknown table 'migrations' - handle this differently perhaps?
- [ ] determine how to handle when migrations caused errors
- [ ] what to do when there are files in the migrations directory which are not numbered
- [X] migrations should be executed in order
