- [X] warn when creating migration tables in a non-empty database
- [X] error when there are migrations with duplicate numbers
- [X] determine changes to patch files by running md5sum of migrations
- [ ] determine how to handle when migrations caused errors
- [ ] use 'set -e'
- [ ] do we also want to support rollbacks? (e.g. down migrations)
- [ ] make sure this also work on non os x machines
- [ ] think about how the user would resolve our detected errors and perhaps
      provide commands to help him
- [ ] provide a way to pack stacks of migrations into one, to make migrate run faster
- [ ] support sqlite, postgres
- [ ] finish README
- [ ] cleanup temp files used for testing purposes with final signal trap
- [ ] think about: what to do when there is already a migrations table, but
      it's not created by migrate?
- [ ] think about: should we really require the database password to be in the
      migrations configuration file?
- [ ] test when user host privilege is incorrect
- [ ] test when host for schema privilege is incorrect
- [ ] have test suite run standalone: don't require a locally running mysql
      server, instead start mysqld for testing purposes locally (on a
      different port)
- [ ] think about: should we really manage one database at a time? or should
      we migrate 'sets of databases'? yagni for now
- [ ] make sure that 'show tables like migrations' does not throw 'unknown
      table 'migrations' - handle this differently perhaps?
- [ ] when test database is not setup present simple commands to create those
      (create user, db, privileges, etc)
- [ ] determine if something safer than md5, such as sha1, is needed for this
      application. make a trade off for this and portability
- [ ] migration IDs should be positive integers
- [X] test: only .sql files are treated as migration files
- [X] what to do when there are files in the migrations directory which are
      not numbered
- [X] migrations should be executed in order
